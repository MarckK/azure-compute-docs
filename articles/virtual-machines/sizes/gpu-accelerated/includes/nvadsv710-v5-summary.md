The NVads V710 v5-series virtual machines are powered by AMD Radeonâ„¢ Pro V710 GPUs [add link when published by AMD] and AMD EPYC  9374 F (Genoa) CPUs with a base frequency of 4.3 GHz and all-cores peak frequency of 3.8 GHz. VMs take advantage of the AMD Simultaneous Multithreading technology to assign dedicated vCPU threads to each VM. 

The series provides five options ranging from 1/6th of a GPU with 4-GiB frame buffer to a full V710  GPU with 24-GiB frame buffer. No other GPU licensing is required for use of AMD GPU-based VMs. The NVads V710 v5 VMs also support NVMe for ephemeral local storage capability. 
The  NVads V710 v5-series enables right-sizing for demanding GPU-accelerated applications and cloud-based virtual desktops to provide a seamless end user experience while providing a cost-effective choice for a full range of graphics-enabled desktops.  The VMs are sized to deliver high-quality, interactive gaming experiences in the cloud, optimized for rendering and streaming complex graphics.

For the full GPU VM sizes, this series also supports small to medium inference workloads by taking advantage of the computational IP blocks in the Radeon Pro V710 GPUs.
