| **Product Description** | Create and manually configure individual VMs. Best for small / unique workloads or apps, with no automation features to manage a group of VMs. | Load-balanced VM groups with workload optimization across multiple availability zones, plus automatic scaling. | Manage and automate provisioning of thousands of mixed-size VMs to maximize performance and high availability. |
| **Product Differences**<br><br>See top product capabilities and limitations side by side| - Deploy and manage each VM individually. Fine-tune custom applications—no group management, optimization, or scaling.<br> - Each VM can be assigned to one availability zone at a time.<br> - Schedule automatic backups or perform them manually | - Deploy and manage up to 2,000 mixed-size VMs as a group <br> - Scale automatically <br> - Optimization across multiple zones and fault domains for high availability <br>- Integrate Azure Spot VMs to cut costs <br>- Optimized for stateless or stateful workloads | - Deploy and manage up to 10,000 mixed-size VMs as a group, and add/remove VM sizes anytime<br>- Optimization across multiple zones / fault domains for high availability<br>- Hyper-scale with demand, and maintain capacity with Spot VMs to cut costs<br>- Configure fleet to allocate strategically, optimizing price, capacity, or both
| **Best for**<br><br>Find the right product for your project | Small, simple jobs or specialized apps where creating / managing individual VMs is feasible. Use to test configurations, experiment with Azure, or when you don't need to optimize resiliency or capacity. | More than one VM, or if you plan to scale. Platform engineering or infrastructure as code implementations; moving on-premises apps to the cloud; specialized workloads for high-performance computing; open-source databases; or batch processing. Built-in optimizations maintain performance while controlling costs—you only pay for capacity used. Mix VM sizes for more flexibility. | Large scale compute-intensive workloads or batch jobs. Choose this option if you want flexibility with VM sizes or want to combine discounted pricing models in addition to optimizing costs on a large scale with Azure Spot. |
| **Cost**<br><br>For specific pricing numbers, check out the [Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) | - Billed as an individual VM instance <br>- Cost-effective for consistent load and traffic | - VMSS automatically uses less capacity when load/traffic is low, and optimizes cost while accommodating the dips and spikes of cyclical, intermittent, and growing workloads <br> - Use 100% Spot VMs, or mix with standard ones, to cut cost | - Combine discounts (like reserved instances and savings plans) with Spot VM savings, plus rank the top VM sizes you want Fleet to prioritize <br>- Your fleet will maintain capacity with discounted Spot VMs to optimize cost
| **Scaling** | Vertical Scaling: <br>- Change the VM's size manually <br><br>Horizontal Scaling: <br>- None | Vertical Scaling: <br>- Change any VM's size manually <br><br>Horizontal Scaling: <br>- Manually add/remove instances <br>- Autoscale based on demand, schedule, or AI-predicted usage patterns| Vertical Scaling: <br>- Change any VM's size manually <br><br>Horizontal Scaling:<br>- Manually managed through modifying the target capacity |
| **Instances** | Single instances deployed individually | 2 to 2,000 instances | Up to 10,000 instances |
| **Management** | Deploy and manage each VM individually | - Deploy and manage VMs as a group, or opt to manage them individually<br>- Orchestrate batch operations (start, stop, restart) and updates (configuration, app, security, and patching) for safer rollouts<br>- Attach and manage one universal add-on for services like data disk and public IP at the VMSS level | - Deploy and manage up to 10,000 VMs as an automated fleet-managed group<br>- Enhance the flexibility, efficiency and control of your VMs, attaching one universal add-on for services like data disk and Public IPs |
| **Availability + Zonal migration** | Manually deploy each standalone VM into a single availability zone. To boost uptime, place one or more VMs into each eligible availability zone | - Automatically deploy and spread VMs into one, or across multiple, availability zones (zonal or zone-spanning) to boost resilience and uptime <br>- Remove VM instances from the VMSS anytime | Fleet uses availability zones to automatically deploy and distribute VMs across multiple zones. Choose specific zones, all eligible zones, or all eligible zones within a given region.
